Code:
 - General:
   - [ ] change all text outputs to be configured by a yml file, so that they are not hardcoded
   - [ ] make a version, which does NOT shout every single "debug" message into minecraft chat
   - [ ] Futureplan: switch to that https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/dream-yaml.87789/ (for performance)
 - Job System:
   - [X] make the hunter the only one who gets a good amount (normal amount) of flesh by hunting. others should only get flesh on every third animal or smth like that => already know everything
   - [ ] do the same for farmers, because thats not yet implemented => need more knowledge
   - [ ] look at configurations, is it uniform (is a blacksmith really the only one who can craft his stuff)
   - [ ] command for list all jobs, and how many players have the job
   - [ ] Knight gets some (1000-4000) xp removed, if he triggers a raid
   - [ ] add nether mobs to default config
   - [ ] classes get normal xp by their profession ??
   - [ ] how will the mage get normal xp? (maybe jsut give him unlimited?) => no classes need xp => make it, so the warriors can give him xp JEAHH
 - Finance System:
   - [ ] Edit this todo list
   - [ ] add feedback to the commands
   - [ ] especially on rewrite, a class which contains arrays of materials and mobs (friendly mobs, wood stuff,stone stuff, and so on) => would greatly simplify stuff
   - [ ] add IRON and DIAMOND stuff to denyCraft in every class

Wiki:
 - [ ] change the Potion/Effect page to be a table
 - [ ] create a Item/Block page
 - [ ] create a page for the interact.yml
 - [ ] create a page for the xp.yml
 - [ ] create a page for the job.yml
