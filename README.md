# RolePlay ![Maven Build](https://github.com/chibbi/RolePlay/workflows/Maven%20Build/badge.svg?branch=main&event=push) ![pre-release](https://github.com/chibbi/RolePlay/workflows/pre-release/badge.svg?branch=main)
RolePlay is a Spigot plugin that is under very active development and adds jobs that you have to commit to ~~and a financial system~~.
It currently let's you choose one job, in which you specialize, and you depend on others to have different jobs, to be able to progress.    

An example gameplay would be, that you are a miner, who is the only one who can use good pickaxes. But nbecause your not good at forging, you need a blacksmith, who can craft you a good pickaxe, otherwise the blacksmith needs you, because you are the only one who can use the pickaxes and give him ores => something to work.    
There are also farmer, which will be the only ones who can efficiently give food, and hunters which will be the only ones who can efficiently hunt. it is not thought of, to completly deny hunting and farming for other players, but that is still in development.
